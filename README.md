## About me

I studied a BA in Economics at Tecnológico de Monterrey and an MSc in Environmental Technology at Imperial College London.

I am currently doing a MSc in Data Science at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México.

I have worked six years in the environmental sector because I believe that the biggest threat to humanity is climate change.

I am also a Chevening Alumni because I the UK government grant me a scholarship to study my master at Imperial College London.

The Nature Conservancy and the Biennial of the Americas appointed me to be a Delegate of the Youth Congress for Sustainable Americas to connect the future leaders that will tackle climate change and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
